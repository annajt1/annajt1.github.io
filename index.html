         <p> If your child needs some support with literacy, I can help them reach their potential. I specialize in both English Language and Literature, having over 30 years classroom experience teaching KS3, GCSE and A Level. 
         <p>  I have also been a DSL for many years and hold an enhanced DBS. 
         <p>  I have had recent experience with a variety of exam boards-AQA, Edexcel and WJEC.
         <p>  I offer bespoke 1:1 lessons online and face to face. Small group online lessons are also available. Please feel free to contact me for a chat about your child's needs.

    <h3> Client Reviews </h3>
        <blockquote> She has been a great tutor to my son for his GCSE year.  In his case, he asked for English language lessons - his engagement in class and results can be quite variable so the aim was to smooth out and improve his performance in this subject.  He has very much enjoyed the (online) classes and likes the tutor who has taught him well and been very flexible throughout.  In particular he found the past papers very useful.  It has given him the best possible opportunity to live up to his potential.  Thank you!  <cite> RB, 2023</cite> </blockquote>
        <blockquote> I would highly recommend the tutor, she has worked with my daughter this academic year leading up to her GCSEs  all via Zoom which has been no issue at all. My daughters grades have improved significantly, which in turn has helped her confidence in both English Language and Literature. She has worked with her to plan the weekly sessions so they are covering work that is relevant at the time. The sessions are very well structured and well planned. So grateful for her help.  <cite> GD, 2024 </cite> </blockquote>
         <blockquote> She tutored my daughter on the lead up to her GCSEâ€™s this year. She has a lovely, gentle nature and made the lessons fun and interesting.  <cite> HK, 2021 </cite> </blockquote>
